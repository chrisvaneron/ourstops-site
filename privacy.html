<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 20, 2026</p>
<p>OurStops ("we", "our", or "the app") is operated by Chris VanEron. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the OurStops mobile application.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Account information</h3>
<p>When you create a creator account, we collect your name, email address, and authentication credentials. If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive basic profile information (name and email) from those providers. We do not store your Google or Apple passwords.</p>

<h3>Location data</h3>
<p>OurStops uses your device's location to determine when you arrive at a stop. Location data is processed on your device to check proximity to stops. We do not store, transmit, or sell your precise location to any third party. If you enable background location access, your device may continue checking proximity while the app is not in the foreground.</p>

<h3>Content you create</h3>
<p>Creators may upload photos and voice notes as part of an experience. This content is stored securely in our cloud infrastructure and is only accessible to the creator and recipients who have been explicitly invited via a unique invite code.</p>

<h3>Experience progress</h3>
<p>If a recipient opts in to sharing progress, we record which stops have been unlocked so the experience creator can follow along. This is optional and can be turned off at any time.</p>

<h3>Analytics and crash data</h3>
<p>We use Firebase Analytics to understand how the app is used (e.g., which features are popular) and Firebase Crashlytics to detect and fix crashes. This data is anonymized and does not include your personal content or precise location.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To provide and operate the OurStops experience</li>
<li>To authenticate your identity</li>
<li>To deliver content (photos, voice notes, messages) between creators and recipients</li>
<li>To determine proximity to stops for unlocking</li>
<li>To improve app stability and performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. We use the following third-party services solely to operate the app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> &mdash; authentication, data storage, crash reporting, and analytics</li>
<li><strong>Google Maps</strong> &mdash; map display and address search</li>
</ul>
<p>These services have their own privacy policies and are used in accordance with their terms.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Account data and experience content are retained as long as your account is active. Creators can delete their experiences at any time, which removes all associated content (photos, voice notes, invite codes). If you wish to delete your account entirely, contact us at the email below.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS), Firebase security rules that restrict data access to authorized users, and signed URLs for media access. No method of electronic transmission is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to protect your information.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>OurStops is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data at any time by contacting us. You can also revoke location permissions through your device settings.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and the effective date will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at:<br>
