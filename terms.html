<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 20, 2026</p>
<p>Welcome to OurStops. By using the OurStops mobile application ("the app"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>OurStops is a location-based experience app that allows creators to build multi-stop journeys with messages, photos, and voice notes. Recipients unlock stops by physically visiting locations. The app is operated by Chris VanEron.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use OurStops. By using the app, you represent that you meet this requirement.</p>

<h2>3. Accounts</h2>
<p>Creators must create an account to build experiences. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure. You agree to provide accurate information and to notify us if you believe your account has been compromised.</p>
<p>Recipients may use the app without creating an account. An anonymous session is created automatically when you enter an invite code.</p>

<h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable</li>
<li>Use the app to stalk, intimidate, or harm another person</li>
<li>Upload content that infringes on intellectual property rights of others</li>
<li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the app's systems or other users' data</li>
<li>Use the app for any commercial purpose without our written permission</li>
<li>Interfere with or disrupt the app's infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right to remove content and suspend accounts that violate these terms.</p>

<h2>5. Content Ownership</h2>
<p>You retain ownership of the content you create and upload (photos, voice notes, messages). By uploading content, you grant OurStops a limited license to store, process, and deliver that content to intended recipients as part of the app's functionality. This license ends when you delete the content or your account.</p>

<h2>6. Content Expiration</h2>
<p>Active experiences expire automatically 7 days after a recipient joins. When an experience expires, all associated content (photos, voice notes, messages, and invite codes) is permanently deleted. It is your responsibility to save any content you wish to keep before expiration.</p>

<h2>7. Location Services</h2>
<p>The app uses your device's location to determine proximity to stops. Location data is processed on your device and is not stored on our servers. You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings, but the app's core functionality requires location access.</p>

<h2>8. Availability</h2>
<p>We strive to keep OurStops available, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The app may be temporarily unavailable for maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. We are not liable for any loss resulting from downtime.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>OurStops is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to loss of data or content.</p>

<h2>10. Account Termination</h2>
<p>You may delete your account at any time by contacting us. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your content will be deleted.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and the effective date will be updated. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the app shall be resolved in the courts of the State of California.</p>

<h2>13. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at:<br>
